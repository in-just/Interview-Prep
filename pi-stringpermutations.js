/* 
Problem: Implement a routine that prints all possible orderings of the characters in a string. In other words, print all permutations that use all the characters from the original string. 

Ex: "hat" -> "tha", "aht", "tah", "ath", "hta", and "hat"
Treat each character as an as a distinct character, even if repeated. "aaa" -> prints "aaa" six times.
